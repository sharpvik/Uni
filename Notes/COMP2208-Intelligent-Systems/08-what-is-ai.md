# What is AI?

The humanity has been thinking, imagining and making movies about human AI for
at least a few decades now. Sometimes, AI takes a robotic form, sometimes, more
human-like. In some films, AI doesn't really have a body.

## AI Today

Today, AI is everywhere, in all shapes and forms. Including Boston Dynamics
robots, IBM Watson, robots, Alpha Go, and many many more...

## What is Intelligence?

Intelligence has many domains. Some of them are addressed by the contemporary
AI, others aren't.

For a long time, we thought that if we create an AI that bets humans in chess,
we'd have cracked the AI. Howerver, now that we have such computers,
it turns out that making an AI for the neat game of chess, where everything is
deterministic and states are 100% observable, does not equal to making an AI for
the _real world use cases_.

Multiple "goal states" for AI can be defined in terms of home human, biological
or technical, and rational we want it to be. Should AI feel emotions? Should we
make robots look like humanoids, or try to improve on the natural state of
things?

## Can machines have minds?

Of course they can! Humans are bio-chemical machines and we have a mind.

Let's rephrase our question then:

> What kind of machines can have intelligence?

This is what the field of AI is about right now.

## Brains = Computers?

Brains certainly do process information, of many different kinds too. It is
clear today, that some functions of the brain can be replicated by a computer.
For example, playing chess, making plans, solving problems, and even cooking a
meal.

However, at this time, we are not sure whether there are some things that cannot
be replicated by a computer. It may turn out that we need some sort of other
mechanisms (chemical ones, perhaps) to create a complete(?) AI.
