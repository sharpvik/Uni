# The Process of Interaction Design

## Four Approaches to Interaction Design

> The purest form of any of these is unlikely to be realised.

1. User-centered design (user knows best LOL);
2. Activity-centered design (how users _use_ your thing?);
3. Systems design (strctured and rigorous process used for _complex_ issues);
4. Genius design (creator knows best!).

Jim Leftwich prefers _'rapid expert design'_ where user's role is to keep the
creator in check by providing feedback while the creative power is still in the
hands of the author.

> Such design may not be by choice, but due to insufficient resources.

## Three Fundamental Activities Common To All Design

1. Understanding the requirements;
2. Producing a design that satisfies those requirements;
3. Evaluating that design.

In _interaction design_ we perform all of the above and with a clear focus on
the final user and their goal. This constraint, adds another important activity
to our list: prototyping (so that users can interact with the design).

Design also involves a fair deal of _trade-offs_. Choosing between those is a
matter of experience and evaluation of _alternative solutions_. Use
**brainstorming** for best results!

## Principles of User-Centered Approach

1. Early focus on users and tasks;
2. Empirical measurement or users' responses;
3. Iterative design.
